# ðŸ“œ scroll backup system

**scroll** is a configurable backup system with support for [restic][restic] and [rsync][rsync] backends. It features:
* Configurable compound commands called **plans**
* Backups to multiple `restic` backends in a single command
* **Frozen** `restic` snapshots that will never be pruned by the `trim` command
* An efficient trimming strategy for `restic` backends
* Automatic **tagging** to allow multiple targets from multiple hosts to coexist in a single `restic` repository
* Automatic `HOST/TARGETNAME` directory structure for `rsync` backends, allowing multiple targets from multiple hosts to coexist in a single location
* Support for **email reports**
* scroll is **multi-platform**. Currently tested under Linux and Windows.

# Overview

**scroll** is simple to use. To backup all targets to all backends:

```sh
# Dots are wildcards
scroll backup . .
```

To backup two targets (`docs,art`) to a single backend (`remote`):

```sh
# Multiple targets or backends are seperated with a comma
scroll backup docs,art remote
```

To restore a target (`docs`) from a backend (`remote`) to a local path (`/home/nn`):

```sh
# Dots are wildcards
scroll restore docs remote /home/nn
```

## Scheduling

Note that **scroll** currently has no built-in scheduling; to run backup operations automatically you'll need to use whatever facilities your system provides for that (cron, systemd timers, Windows' Task Scheduler). In the future **scroll** may provide a scheduling daemon to be more system-agnostic.

# Configuration

Scroll is configured using YAML. Under Linux, the default configuration file location is `/etc/scroll/scroll.yaml`.

Below is an example configuration:

```yaml
backends:
  repo-a: ./data/repo-a
  repo-b: snap::./data/repo-b
  sync-a: sync::./data/sync-a
  sync-b: sync::./data/sync-b
targets:
  test1:
    path:
      - ./data/target/dir1
      - ./data/target/dir2
    exclude: ./data/target/dir1/exc
    policy: --keep-daily 7
  test2:
    path: ./data/target/dir5
  test3:
    path: ./data/target/dir8
plan:
  - "backup test1 repo-a,repo-b"
  - "backup test2 sync-a"
  - "backup test3 sync-b"
  - "trim . ."

```

# Commands

**`help / h [COMMAND]`**

**`backup / b [TARGET] [REPO] [TAG...]`**

Backup TARGET to REPO, with optional TAGs.

**`trim / t [TARGET] [REPO]`**

Forget and prune snapshots for TARGET in REPO.

**`find / f TARGET REPO [PATH...]`**

Search for snapshots containing one or more PATHs in the given TARGET and REPO.

**`restore / r TARGET REPO PATH`**

Restore the given TARGET from REPO to PATH.

**`unlock / u [REPO]`**

Unlock REPO, or all repos.

**`check / c [REPO] [ARG...]`**

Check the integrity of REPO, or all repos.

**`x [REPO] [ARG...]`**
